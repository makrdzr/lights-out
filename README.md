# 💡 Lights Out Game

Logic puzzle game "Lights Out".
Implemented on React + TypeScript + Vite.

## 🎮 Game Rules

The game consists of a grid of lights that can be switched on or off.

- **Interaction:** Clicking on a cell toggles its state and the state of its adjacent neighbors (top, bottom, left, right).
- **Goal:** Turn off all the lights on the grid.
- **Challenge:** Try to achieve this in the minimum number of steps!

## 🛠 Technology stack

- **Core:** React, TypeScript, Vite
- **Styles:** Tailwind CSS
- **Forms:** React Hook Form + Zod
- **Routing:** React Router
- **State Management:** Zustand
- **Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library
- **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose

## 🚀 How to launch a project

### Without Docker (requires Node.js)

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lights-out
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the project**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### With Docker (requires only Docker)

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd lights-out
   ```

2. **Start development server**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d dev
   ```

App will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

3. **Run npm commands inside the container**

   ```bash
   docker compose exec dev npm run test
   docker compose exec dev npm run tidy
   ```

4. **Preview production build locally**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d prod
   ```

5. **Rebuild after code changes**

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d prod --build
   ```

App will be available at `http://localhost:80`

## ✨ Implemented best practises

1. **Component-Based Architecture**
   - **Description:** The project follows a clear, modular structure by separating UI into distinct component categories: pages, layouts, and reusable UI/game components. This enhances maintainability and scalability.
   - **Evidence:** `src/pages/GamePage.tsx`, `src/layouts/ContainerLayout.tsx`, `src/components/ui/Button.tsx`, `src/components/game/GameGrid.tsx`.

2. **Code Quality & Consistency with ESLint and Prettier**
   - **Description:** The project enforces code quality and consistent formatting using ESLint for linting and Prettier for code formatting. This ensures a uniform codebase and helps prevent common errors.
   - **Evidence:** `eslint.config.js`, `.prettierrc`, `.prettierignore`, `package.json` (for scripts).

3. **Advanced State Management & Persistence with Zustand**
   - **Description:** Global state is managed using Zustand with its `persist` middleware. This implementation ensures that game settings, player history, and active game sessions are preserved across page reloads, providing a seamless user experience.
   - **Features:**
     - **Session Recovery:** Active games (grid state, steps, timer) are saved in real-time, allowing players to resume exactly where they left off.
     - **Game History:** Persistent log of the last 10 games played.
     - **Personal Bests:** Tracks the minimum steps taken to win for each grid size.
   - **Evidence:** `src/store/settings.ts`, `src/store/results.ts`, and `src/store/game.ts`.

4. **Strong Typing with TypeScript**
   - **Description:** The entire codebase is written in TypeScript, providing type safety that prevents common bugs, improves code completion, and makes the code self-documenting.
   - **Evidence:** All `.ts` and `.tsx` files in the project, such as `src/types/settings.ts` and component prop definitions.

5. **Declarative Routing**
   - **Description:** The application uses React Router to declaratively define its pages and navigation flow, making the application structure easy to understand and manage.
   - **Evidence:** The routing configuration is defined in `src/router/index.tsx`.

6. **PWA & Mobile-First Experience**
   - **Description:** The application is designed to feel like a native mobile app and is a fully functional Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline capabilities.
   - **Features:**
     - **Offline Support:** Using Service Workers (via `vite-plugin-pwa`), the game can be played without an internet connection once loaded.
     - **"Add to Home Screen":** Complete set of icons and a web manifest allow users to install the game on their devices.
     - **Responsive Layout:** The grid and UI components are fluidly scaled to fit any screen size (from 320px up), using CSS Grid and `aspect-square` for consistent cell rendering.
   - **Evidence:** `vite.config.ts`, `src/main.tsx`, `public/favicon/`, and `index.html`.

7. **Testing**
   - **Description:** The project includes unit and component tests written with Jest and React Testing Library, covering core game logic, Zustand stores, and UI components.
   - **Evidence:** `src/hooks/__tests__/`, `src/store/__tests__/`, `src/components/**/__tests__/`.

8. **Containerization with Docker**
   - **Description:** The project includes a multi-stage Dockerfile and Docker Compose configuration, allowing development and production environments to run without installing Node.js locally.
   - **Features:**
     - **Dev container:** Vite dev server with hot reload and volume mounting for live code updates.
     - **Prod container:** Optimized production build served via Nginx.
   - **Evidence:** `Dockerfile`, `compose.yaml`, `nginx.conf`, `.dockerignore`.
